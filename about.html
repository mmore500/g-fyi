  <h1>Understanding the Data</h1>
  
  <br>
  <p><b>Data Source</b> &ndash;  This website pulls directly from <a href="http://publish.gwinnett.k12.ga.us/gcps/home/public/schools/content/return-to-learning-hub/covid19-info-by-school" target="_blank">publicly available Gwinnett County Public Schools (GCPS) data</a>. As the data on the website are provided as discrete pdf files per day, it can be difficult to see patterns. This website therefore serves as a way to visualize the data for interested stakeholders. </p></p>
  <p> You may be aware of cases which are not appearing in this dashboard; please follow up directly with your local school or GCPS to correct these errors. This website is dependent on the quality of timely reporting by GCPS; while the data here can be helpful in visually determining where underreporting may be happening, it is up to the community to accurately and swiftly report cases and the administration at the schools and GCPS leadership to accurately and swiftly convey this information. </p>
  <p>The categories and operating procedures below are how GCPS has defined cases (see link above). This website does not make any attempts to update the information based on current CDC or Georgia DPH guidance which may differ from GCPS procedures. The goal is that this website track the GCPS response and commensurate data reporting. This information is intended to contextualize what is being shared by the county as current operating procedure alongside the data generated under such procedure.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Data categories as reported by GCPS:</b></p>
  
<p><b>1. Positive Case</b> &ndash; A person who receives a lab-confirmed positive COVID-19 test result, or a physician&rsquo;s diagnosis of COVID-19.</p>

<p><b>2. Suspected Case</b> &ndash; A person who displays any of the common symptoms of COVID-19 but is waiting to be tested or to receive the results of a test already administered. These common symptoms include a fever of 100.4 degrees or higher, unusual fatigue, muscle pain, coughing, sudden loss of taste or smell, difficulty breathing, prolonged headache, and sore throat, that do not appear to be caused by another illness. A person who is a suspected case displays symptoms but has not tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p><b>3. Close Contact</b> &ndash; A person who is not ill but who has been exposed to a positive COVID-19 case in a manner that could make the person susceptible to contracting the virus. Examples include a person who:
  <ul>
  <li>Lives with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.</li>
  <li>Was face-to-face with a positive case, while wearing or not wearing a mask or face covering, fewer than 6 feet apart for 15 minutes or longer.</li>
  <li>Had direct physical contact with a positive case, such as sharing a drink.</li>
  <li>Was exposed to the bodily fluids of a person with COVID-19 (for example, touched a facial tissue used by an infected person).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>4. New Cases</b> &ndash; The number of new cases reported for a specific day. This chart does not include all schools, only those reporting a new case for that day.</p>

<p><b>5. Total Active Cases</b> &ndash; This chart reflects total active cases by school based on the expected return dates of those affected. It does not reflect those who are cleared medically to return to school/work before that expected date, or those who are out beyond their expected return date. Information about when an individual actually returns is tracked manually at the school or workplace and is not captured in this report.</p>

<h1>Understanding the Graphs and Tables</h1>
<br>  
<p>The graph and data table explanations below are intended to help users understand the data when presented visually. They are organized by tab on the website. As GCPS provides two daily tables (active and new cases) and no publicly available visuals for this data on their website, these graphs and tables that display more detailed analyses over time needed to be constructed. These visuals use data that GCPS has provided, but are limited to the quality of that data. GCPS makes no claims to produce these visuals or related information to help the public interpret the data.</p> 
<p> The images used alongside the explanations are static images on this page. To see the most current data, or to examine custom patterns by clicking on options, you will need to navigate to the associated tab. </p>
<br>
<b>1. Overview Tab</b>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
      <h5 style="text-align: center;"> Total Daily Active Cases</h5>
      <img src="overview1.png" style="width:350px; height:200px;">
      <div class="text-column">
      
      <p>This graph depicts the total active cases in the limited window that GCPS reports, as defined by 'Total active cases' above. It is useful for monitoring patterns relative to those of the county at large, but note the accuracy limitations of this data as described by the county in 'Total active cases' above</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column">
      <h5 style="text-align: center;">Cummulative Distribution of Total Active Cases</h5>
      <img src="overview2.png" style="width:350px; height:200px;">
      <div class="text-column">
      <p>This graph shows the relative distributions of suspected cases, positive cases, and close contacts over time. It is useful for understanding cummulative impacted individuals over time and may be useful for for assessing contact tracing efficacy.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
      <h5 style="text-align: center;">Days with Most Reported Active Cases  </h5>
      <img src="overview3.png" style="width:350px; height:200px;">
      <div class="text-column">
      <p>This graph shows the days with the most active reported cases; these dates often will often shorly follow super-spreader events, such as those seen in several sports events and other large gatherings across the county.</p>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<br><br>


<b>2. Cluster Tab</b>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
      <h5 style="text-align: center;"> Total Active Cases by Cluster</h5>
        <img src="cluster3.png" style="width:350px; height:200px;">
        <div class="text-column">
      <p>This information allows you to sort by active cases. Should a cluster report higher cases relative to neighbors, it may be a result of better reporting of cases in that cluster relative to those surrounding or a recent super-spreader event.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column">
      <h5 style="text-align: center;">Total Active Cases By Cluster</h5>
      <img src="cluster1.png" style="width:350px; height:200px;">
      <div class="text-column">
      <p>This interactive graph lets you compare the clusters against one another over time. This information lets you know whether a cluster is on a good trajectory and what that trajectory is relative to other clusters.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column">
      <h5 style="text-align: center;">Specific Cluster Daily Cases</h5>
      <img src="cluster2.png" style="width:350px; height:200px;">
      <div class="text-column">
      <p>This graph lets you compare and also to monitor the reported outcomes and relative levels of contact tracing from previous outbreaks.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  
</div>

<br><br>
<b>3. School Tab</b>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
      <h5 style="text-align: center;">Covid Cases in Schools</h5>
      <img src="school3.png" style="width:350px; height:200px;">
      <div class="text-column">
      <p>This information lets you observe the ratio of Covid cases (positive + suspected) compared to close contacts. This can help you make inferences about how big a reported exposure may be and whether all parties have been notified. Generally, a positive case will have far more close-contacts than a close-contact will repeatedly contact separate Covid-positive cases. Therefore, high numbers on this table can suggest limited contact tracing or large outbreaks in defined clusters, such as a single classroom (more common in lower grades).</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column">
      <h5 style="text-align: center;">Positive and Suspected Cases vs Close Contacts</h5>
      <img src="school1.png" style="width:350px; height:200px;">
      <div class="text-column">
      <p>This interactive graph lets you compare schools against one another over time. This information lets you know whether a school is on a good trajectory and what that trajectory is relative to other schools, and combined with the cluster data, can help inform the potential degree of reported spread in the local community (i.e. between schools within a cluster or across the county following inter-school events, such as sporting events). In more severe cases, a detectable peak in data in one school will tend to follow a previous peak at another school.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  
    <div class="column">
      <h5 style="text-align: center;">Percentage of Active Cases in School</h5>
      <img src="school2.png" style="width:350px; height:200px;">
      <div class="text-column">
      <p>This pie chart parses out the three case types (positive, suspected, and close-contacts). If the close-contacts are relatively low compared to the true cases, this can be indicative of underreporting; if over time this trend continues along with cases rising, asymptomatic spread is likely, assuming testing data is being reported accurately. It can also indicate when a single class has had an outbreak in lower-years, where students remain in a single classroom all day and do not intermix with the school at large.</p>

<b>4. Table Tab</b>
      <p>This is the combined, pulled data from GCPS reporting. The clusters have been added from <a href= "https://publish.gwinnett.k12.ga.us/gcps/home/public/about/content/!ut/p/z0/fcyxCsIwFIXhp-lY7gVTde2kLego7V1CGkONhpu0ScTHN4qz4_n4OUAwALF62lkl61m5skfayk17wk4I7A_igtjtjk2_PwtEbKAH-h-UB3tfFmqBtOdkXgmGWYcoQ56c1fKLnKThHCv8YbTJVBj1zXtX9NPX2uWYzFpPPvNVrdZECA8a38U5EOk!/", target="_blank"> the GCPS cluster map</a>, as well as the ability to download the larger dataset for error-checking and other analyses.</p>
